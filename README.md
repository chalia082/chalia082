### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a driven computer engineering graduate from Southern Methodist University, seeking a full-time position as a software developer. With a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, C/C++, JavaScript, and SQL, and a thorough understanding of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, I am well-equipped to contribute significantly to any software development team.
